Competences are the ability to solve problems in an area and also willingness to do so. They should guide the content of sessions and learning strategies within our curriculum, and are meant as a point of reference. 

The following are the competences we consider relevant for competent developers:

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback

Adequate feedback is a requirement of personal growth, teamwork, and product development. Once a course can benefit from peer-feedback, the responsibility of learning shifts from the teacher to the group as a whole. There are several models that can guide someone's understanding here. Also, the pset and the challenges workflow include elements of peer-feedback. And in companies, code-review is an important element of effective and understandable code. 

#### Recognizing and Producing Code Quality

If you learn something right from the beginning, it will save you time and problems in the future. This is true for learning an instrument as it is for writing code. That's why we orientate our feedback on 9 criteria in 4 dimensions. These are used in the feedback forms, to create a base for discussions. The dimensions are Documentation, Presentation, Algorithms and Structure, and the criteria can be found under tools and templates.

#### Using and Combining Different Technologies

We talked to CTO's who said they need developers who can work with multiple languages and technologies. Not only does this allow for more flexibility in tasks, but also it helps understand the sources of problems and bugs. By knowing C and understanding memory on a low-level, trouble shooting becomes easier. Also, you're more flexible to adapt to a new language, when you already know a few.

#### Collaboration and Project Management

It's the exception that one person alone programs an app, especially in companies. At some point work needs to be distributed, which means collaboration and project management become important. There are several tools and methods for this. We will use GitHub from day one (thanks to their nonprofit support), and also understand and apply agile principles. Words like Scrummaster, Kanban, Repositories and merge errors will have meaning afterwards.

#### User Experience Testing

Being able to develop apps is one thing, but knowing how to build apps people will actually use and enjoy is another thing. How to get from an idea to a prototype often has little to do with coding and more with listening to users. So first we start with user stories, then we build fake apps to test them, and continuously add more realness until we have a working prototype. 

#### Self-Directed Learning

An important skill programmers need is learning independently and finding information. Technology is changing so fast, that people call themselves "junior developer for life" because they will never know everything. Additionally, effective learners are more independent and self-confident about their skills. It helps to know where to look for information, how to read other people's projects, and understand libraries and frameworks to build projects on them.

#### Communication and English

And finally, effective communication is a must in the workplace and can prevent clashes of cultures. Managers, clients and colleagues can really appreciate clear communication and this is an advantage in any field of work. Also for job applications, this can often make or break the first impression. Our courses are taught in English because this is the language most relevant coding content is written in. Many companies have therefore also adopted English as a workplace language.
