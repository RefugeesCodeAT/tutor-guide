# Activity Types

Every week plan is filled with a number of activities, that can be structured in four categories

| Sessions | Coding Café | Coaching & Review | Events |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| e.g. TU-Session, Lecture week 2 \(moderated\), workshop "learning how to learn", GitHub's Version Control Workshop, Walkthrough pset 2. | e.g. Monday 10-15h at "Aux Gazelles", Mariahilfer Straße 6. With Rafi. | e.g. Monday Morning Coaching, and 360° Weekly Review. | e.g. Hackathon, Movie Screenings, Company Trips, Kick-Off |
| An instructed meeting with a clearly specified purpose. There's a schedule with all the times and locations. | Participants come together and work independently on problem sets and challenges. Colleagues are there for help and motivation. | These meetings are there for motivating and setting direction. Coaching is 1-on-1 and the review is with everybody present. | Events with a strong social function, can also have learning relevance. |
| weekly | weekly | weekly | 1-off / weekly |
| Trainer / Expert / Moderator | Tutor \(+ Trainer\) | Coach / Moderator, Scribe | Event Manager |

[We have a weekly schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1btDX1hEYpJBWb2xB_J-icIBIPD1bIp7tQkF0JT5vA0E/edit?usp=sharing "Our Google Sheet with current sessions.") that will be embedded on moodle. It uses p2 for event descriptions, and is synchronised with a calendar. More about this under Tools & Templates.

#### Sessions

Sessions are moderated and have a clearly specified purpose. The purposes can be different though:

* to offer course support in a specific way, e.g. watching a lecture together.
* to work on a competence in a structured and weekly basis. 
* to offer an extra course, which is not directly related to the competences but may be interesting

Tutors should be the same, or at least one person should be responsible and organising. Inviting external people of course is possible, if not encouraged. The didactic concept is left to the person.

One-time lectures without a week-structure and structured purpose are events.

To initiate a session, speak with the trainer who is responsible for the intake. Create a rough week-structure, where it is fine to fill in events later, or even invite participants to take over a part. The trainer will ask you to create a post on P2, and update the weekly schedule with your event. 

#### Coaching & Review

The coaching session at the beginning of the week, and the 360° review at the end of the week are there to work with our participants' motivation.
