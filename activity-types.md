# Activity Types

Every week plan is filled with a number of activities, that can be structured in four categories

| Sessions | Coding Café | Coaching & Review | Events |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| e.g. TU-Session, Lecture week 2 \(moderated\), workshop "learning how to learn", GitHub's Version Control Workshop, Walkthrough pset 2. | e.g. Monday 10-15h at "Aux Gazelles", Mariahilfer Straße 6. With Rafi. | e.g. Monday Morning Coaching, and 360° Weekly Review. | e.g. Hackathon, Movie Screenings, Company Trips, Kick-Off |
| An instructed meeting with a clearly specified purpose. There's a schedule with all the times and locations. | Participants come together and work independently on problem sets and challenges. Colleagues are there for help and motivation. | These meetings are there for motivating and setting direction. Coaching is 1-on-1 and the review is with everybody present. | Events with a strong social function, can also have learning relevance. |
| weekly | weekly | weekly | 1-off / weekly |
| Trainer / Expert / Moderator | Tutor \(+ Trainer\) | Coach / Moderator, Scribe | Event Manager |

[We have a weekly schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1btDX1hEYpJBWb2xB_J-icIBIPD1bIp7tQkF0JT5vA0E/edit?usp=sharing "Our Google Sheet with current sessions.") that will be embedded on moodle. It uses p2 for event descriptions, and is synchronised with a calendar. More about this under Tools & Templates.

#### Sessions

Sessions are moderated and have a clearly specified purpose. The purposes can be different though:

* to offer course support in a specific way, e.g. watching a lecture together.
* to work on a competence in a structured and weekly basis. 
* to offer an extra course, which is not directly related to the competences but may be interesting

Tutors should be the same, or at least one person should be responsible and organising. Inviting external people of course is possible, if not encouraged. The didactic concept is left to the person.

One-time lectures without a week-structure and structured purpose are events.

To initiate a session, speak with the trainer who is responsible for the intake. Create a rough week-structure, where it is fine to fill in events later, or even invite participants to take over a part. The trainer will ask you to create a post on P2, and update the weekly schedule with your event. 

#### Coaching & Review

The coaching session at the beginning of the week, and the 360° review at the end of the week are there to work with our participants' motivation. 

##### Coaching

Coachings are there to keep the (personal) goals in sight, it's a chance to connect to individual goals, needs, and expectations. Also, it helps understand the participants and give them the feeling of appreciation for their being, another important factor in the learning process.

Coachings can be done one a one-to-one basis with a coach, or in smaller subgroups. They can be strongly moderated, or just a personal talk every week. They can be done with a real-life trainer or a digital mentor, and they can take 15 minutes or an hour. As long as it's a chance to connect to personal goals and create expectations, it's fine. 

Apart from the emotional / personal component, it is also an important instrument for course progress. By using a template, the participant can set her/his learning and output targets for the week together with the coach, and reflect on the suceeses and difficulties of the past week. Also it can serve to check demand for extra courses, for example a design online course. And it can be useful in collecting feedback. 

Questions could go in the direction of:
* How are you feeling? What made you happy last week, what made you sad?
* How do you feel about your output and learning last week?
* Let's go through your hours present, and last week goals.
* What do you want to achieve this week?
* Is there something you really enjoyed learning or would like to learn?
The template is further described under Tools and Templates.

##### 360° Review

At the end of the week participants gather in a circle and share their reflection on the week. Thereby we touch on the extrinsic motivation of people, while also inspring, learning, sharing, and finishing the week in a collective way.

A moderator and a scribe are present, and just guide through the agenda and the process. A suggested structure could be to share four areas: (1) a learning, (2) accomplishments, (3) an open question, (4) a thank you. The scribe can use this chance to track progress of participants, and make notes about possible rewards.

Also this can be made to make announcements to all, praise winners of challenges, etc. Afterwards there can be food or just hanging out.
