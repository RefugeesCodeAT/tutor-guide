# Tools

We have developed several tools to make it easy to organise this course with new participants, new tutors, new challenges, and an agile approach to learning.

### moodle.refugeescode.at

Moodle is the course's platform and grading decisions will take place here. It's purpose was to add structure to Harvard's CS50 course and add quizzes that can be done together. Also, the discussion forum is linked to the tutor's slack channel so they get a notification when help is needed.

Through Moodle, participants can submit their pset for review and tutors can submit grades to the user, although this does not substitute more detailed personal feedback.

Another function of Moodle is to create a space to work on challenges together.

TODO: Finish Description. Think of relationship to ExtraKurs enrolment and grading. 

### GitHub

Through Github, we store our codebase. The Github people were so nice to support our initiative and we can now use private repositories to submit and give feedback on homework, collaborate on challenges, and build awesome new projects during Hackathons. More detailed description in the chapter "Workflow Psets"

### Chatbot and Email List

The chatbot makes enrolment to the moodle course and profile creation easier and in the future can prepare automated continuous enrolment. It has four main functions:

* answer questions about the program,
* let users sign-up for a notification when enrolment opens
* create a moodle profile and enrol for a course
* see moodle deadlines and create messages \(reminders\) before and after the deadline. 
* send out messages and polls to user groups

The chatbot was developed by Sergey Vladimirovich

The email list would be the most formal channel of communication. The chatbot can be used to notify about a new email being sent out, thereby making sure it reaches mail-preferring and fb-preferring users.

### Schedule and calendar

Our Schedule may become the most used tool, and the calendar the most useful tool.

The schedule shows when and where the weekly activities are happening and links to their descriptions in P2. On the one hand, they present the current offers and on the other hand, they give information about the when and the where. 

The Calendar is there to make the participant's lives easier and is a URL that integrates into everybody's calendar with just a link. It allows for live changes and description of the events that are happening.

### p2.refugeescode.at

Originally a microblog, it serves as our session database, easy and quick way to generate a URL to a short info page.

Also users can post here and describe challenges in a more permanent format than Slack allows for. Before they reach the official phase on Moodle, they can stay here. 

In theory, companies can also have an account and post challenges or job-offers there. 

The best way to understand it is by [checking it out](#p2refugeescodeat).
