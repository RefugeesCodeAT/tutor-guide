# Tutor Feedback

Adequate feedback is known to be crucial to effective learning in general. In a description of useful feedback, literature proposes that in order to learn, a person needs to know three things: what good performance on a task is (1), how their own performance relates to good performance (2), and what to do to close the ‘gap’ between those (3). 

## Grading
Grading start in Moodle, where a rubric allows you to pick one of four outcomes for each of the 7 criteria. The results sum up to the final grade, and specific feedback on code is given as a pull request through GitHub. 

The exact pset workflow is described in the course Trainer On-Boarding on moodle. 

## Certificates
At the end of CS50, participants receive a certificate from Harvard, and a confirmation from our organization. To employers, refugees{code} can guarantee that the participants have completed each course themselves, with a high quality standard, and an adequate final project.
