# Challenges

Challenges are there to challenge participants to do something new, additional to CS50. They are a chance to gain further skills, knowledge, or practical experiences for building a portfolio. They can make have types:

* **Do a course.** Wanna learn how to design logo's? Great! Create websites with Wordpress? This is your course. Build a native App. Check out this Stanford Course. 
* **Work on a project.** Some real-life challenge that needs a solution. Creating an App, a hardware device, a website, something to build.
* **Do some exercises.** There are many sites that provide opportunities to practice, which can be found under the Resources chapter. CS50 itself provides some on Github. 

Challenges can be posted on the Moodle Forum, and rewarded with points and badges there. 

Also, they must be linked to the github classroom, finding a way to include collaboration and correction. But that's hard to decide before.
