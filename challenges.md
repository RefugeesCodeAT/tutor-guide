# Challenges

Challenges are there to challenge participants to do something new, additional to CS50. They are a chance to gain further skills, knowledge, or practical experiences for building a portfolio. They can make have types:

* **Do a course.** Wanna learn how to design logo's? Great! Create websites with Wordpress? This is your course. Build a native App. Check out this Stanford Course. 
* **Work on a project.** Some real-life challenge that needs a solution. Creating an App, a hardware device, a website, something to build.
* **Do some exercises.** There are many sites that provide opportunities to practice, which can be found under the Resources chapter. CS50 itself provides some on Github. 

Challenges can be posted on the Moodle Forum, and rewarded with points and badges there. 
The learner gets access to a repository to work and upload code from, through a link from classroom.github.com. Here the tutor describes the task, and can create a code base to start from. 

Important for challenges is, that they are an examplary case that puts several desired competences into a format the learner can refer to. For example, the CS50 pset3 gives music and the happy birthday song as a framework. Its completion combines a set competences: reading a data file, linking different files with code, outputting a new datatype (audio), and using pre-made functions.
